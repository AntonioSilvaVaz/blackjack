# Blackjack
In this project, the initiator of the application can indulge in the classic game of Blackjack, placing bets using in-game tokens while enjoying a range of options mirroring those found in the real-world version of the game. These choices encompass actions such as surrendering, doubling down, taking insurance, and more. This project leverages a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to deliver this immersive gaming experience.
